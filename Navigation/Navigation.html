Lorem Dim Sum: A Tasty Lorem Ipsum Text Generator
When doing design mockups, we simply put the Lorem Ipsum filler to serve as dummy text when there is no copy provided. Design mockups require dummy text to show the client the exact layout and how the text will appear depending on how long they should be.
 
Give a delicious twist to the ordinary Lorem Ipsum and use Lorem Dim Sum instead! Whether for a food related design project or you just want to add a little more fun into your dummy text, Lorem Dim Sum allows you to add words like “mini egg tarts”, “dumpling”, and “steam buns” as filler that will whet the client’s appetite.
 
The Lorem Dim Sum dummy text generator is a brainchild of writer Zach Myrow, art director Matt Kalish, and technologist Chris Allick. The website is designed to look like a Chinese restaurant menu in consistency with the dim sum theme.
